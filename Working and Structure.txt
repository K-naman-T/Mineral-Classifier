Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture: 

In this code, I have used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for mineral classification. CNNs are particularly effective for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial patterns in images. 

Let's break down how the CNN is applied in the code: 

Model Architecture: The CNN model used in the code consists of several layers: 

Convolutional Layers: The code defines a convolutional layer self.conv1 with 16 filters, a kernel size of 3x3, and a stride of 1. This layer applies a set of filters to extract features from the input image. 

Pooling Layer: The code includes a max pooling layer self.pool with a kernel size of 2x2 and a stride of 2. This layer downsamples the spatial dimensions of the input, reducing computational complexity while retaining important features. 

Fully Connected Layers: After the convolutional and pooling layers, the code has two fully connected layers self.fc1 and self.fc2. These layers take the flattened feature maps from the previous layers and perform classification based on the learned features. 

Forward Pass: The forward method defines the forward pass of the CNN. It applies a series of operations to the input image: 

Convolution: The image is passed through the convolutional layer, applying the defined filters to extract features. 

Activation Function: The ReLU activation function (torch.relu) is applied to introduce non-linearity and enhance the network's ability to learn complex patterns. 

Pooling: The output from the activation function is passed through the pooling layer to downsample the feature maps. 

Flattening: The feature maps are flattened into a 1-dimensional vector to be fed into the fully connected layers. 

Fully Connected Layers: The flattened features are passed through the fully connected layers, applying linear transformations and activation functions. 

Output: The final output of the network is obtained, which represents the predicted probabilities for each class. 

Training and Evaluation: During training, the model is trained to optimize its parameters using the Adam optimizer and the Cross Entropy Loss function. The model learns to minimize the difference between its predictions and the true labels. 

During evaluation, the model is switched to evaluation mode (model.eval()) to disable gradient computations and ensure consistent behavior. Test images are passed through the model, and the predicted class labels are obtained by selecting the class with the highest probability (torch.max(outputs, 1)). The predicted labels are then compared with the true labels to calculate accuracy and generate a classification report. 

Accuracy: 

The accuracy of the mineral classification model was measured on the test dataset which was found to be 64% 

Classification Report: 

The classification report provides a detailed evaluation of the model's performance for each mineral class. 

It includes metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Conclusion: 

The model shows promising results in accurately classifying minerals based on the provided dataset. 

The overall accuracy and class-wise metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in identifying different mineral types. 

These results highlight the potential of using deep learning techniques for mineral classification in environmental monitoring and mining applications.
