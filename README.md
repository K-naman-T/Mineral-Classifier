# Comprehensive Documentation for Mineral Classification using PyTorch

## Overview:

This script builds a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for mineral image classification using the PyTorch library. It assumes a dataset structure where each mineral class corresponds to a subdirectory within a parent directory. Each subdirectory should contain images of the respective mineral class. 

The script performs the following key steps:

1. Loads and preprocesses the image data.
2. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
3. Defines a CNN model and a custom PyTorch Dataset.
4. Trains the model using the training set.
5. Evaluates the model's performance on the testing set.

## Dependencies:

The following libraries are required to run this script:

Sure, here are one-liner descriptions for these Python libraries:

- **os**: A module in Python that provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
- **cv2**: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library with bindings for Python.
- **numpy**: A library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- **torch**: PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python, based on Torch, used for applications such as natural language processing and artificial neural networks.
- **torch.nn**: A sub-library of PyTorch, it provides classes to create and manage neural network layers and defines a set of functions to compute common loss functions.
- **torch.optim**: A sub-library of PyTorch that contains standard optimization operations like SGD and Adam.
- **torch.utils.data**: A sub-library of PyTorch that provides utilities for loading and handling datasets in PyTorch.
- **sklearn.model_selection**: A module in scikit-learn that provides utilities for model selection, including methods to split datasets, generate validation curves, and tune parameters.
- **sklearn.metrics**: A module in scikit-learn that includes score functions, performance metrics, and pairwise metrics and distance computations.


## Detailed Description:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**

The script begins by iterating over subdirectories within a given parent directory. Each subdirectory corresponds to a mineral class and contains relevant images. These images are loaded, resized to 100x100 pixels, and stored in a list along with their corresponding labels. This data is then converted into numpy arrays.

2. **Data Splitting**

The data is split into training and testing sets, with an 80-20 split, using scikit-learn's train_test_split function. The training and testing sets are then converted into PyTorch tensors, with the channel dimension moved to the second position (from the last position) to meet PyTorch's input requirements.

3. **Model and Dataset Definition**




4. **Model Training**

The script initializes the CNN model, defines a cross-entropy loss function, and uses the Adam optimizer for training. The model is trained for a predefined number of epochs. For each epoch, the script iterates over the training set, feeds the data to the model, computes the loss, performs backpropagation, and updates the model's parameters.

5. **Model Evaluation**

Finally, the model's performance is evaluated on the testing set. The model's outputs are the class probabilities, and the class with the highest probability is taken as the prediction. The script computes and prints the overall classification accuracy and a classification report, which includes precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class.

## Usage Example:

Before running this script, organize your dataset with each class's images in a separate subdirectory under a common parent directory. Suppose the parent directory is at 'C:\\Users\\KIIT\\Desktop\\mining-py'.

You can then run the script using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python mineral_classification.py
```

The script will train the model and print the classification results.

## Future Improvements and Updates:

This is a basic implementation and serves as a starting point for more sophisticated models. In future iterations, the following updates may be included:

- More complex CNN architectures.
- Data augmentation for improving the model's generalization.
- Save and load functionality for the model's parameters.
- Better error and exception handling.
- Integration with a web-based or GUI-based application for a better user experience.
